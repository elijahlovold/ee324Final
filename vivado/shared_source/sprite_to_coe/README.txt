Make your pixel art, save it as a .png (that way transparent pixels are preserved) then use 
	this program to generate .coe files used in Vivado for Block Memory Generators (ROMs).
This Program works best if you place the program "SpriteToText.exe" in the same directory (folder) 
	as the image you want to convert.
The .coe file generated is formatted to best work with Dr. Murray's code.
The .txt file is good for making sure the .png was read correctly and looks pretty if you put the 
	array into Excel (Google Sheets) and use conditional formatting.
